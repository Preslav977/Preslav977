Nice to meet you! I'm Preslaw

About Me
=========================================================================================================================================

I have been always interested in computers since I was little. Recently I discovered my programming journey with The Odin Project, which made me interested in programming with a building curve from the simplest projects to the most complex ones.
Also learning about algorithms.

This leads to me wanting to learn programming not only as a hobby but to get a job as well. What excites me the most is are the following phases: building, debugging, testing, and finally seeing the product I made. It is not much, but the feeling is incredible.

I am trying to help the community with contributing and am also humbled and excited to be able to contribute to such an amazing resource alongside professionals and fellow contributors in the field.

Recent Projects 
=========================================================================================================================================
I have been learning almost anything from [The Odin Project Curriculum](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum/), in which the goal is aimed at full stack development, creating a programming mindset, honing and improving program-solving skills by researching, reading the documentation, and building your own things on your own. 

Some interesting projects I have worked on:
- Where's Waldo Full Stack Application [built with backend functionality](https://github.com/Preslav977/where-is-everyone-backend) and [frontend](https://github.com/Preslav977/where-is-everyone-frontend) by using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node, tested, with React Testing Library, Vitest, responsive.
- Blog Api Full Stack Application [built with backend functionality](https://github.com/Preslav977/blog-api-backend) and [frontend](https://github.com/Preslav977/blog-api-frontend) contisted with [CMS](https://github.com/Preslav977/blog-api-cms) by using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node, tested, with React Testing Library, Vites, responsive.
